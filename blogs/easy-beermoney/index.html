                        This is an app that uses BlueTooth on your phone to search for nearby devices.
                        At least, thats what the site says. I'm pretty sure they sell your location data because they
                        make
                        you
                        have location enabled otherwise they won't let you earn.

                        I have cashed out many times and I can confirm they are legit. Its slow to earn, though. You get
                        roughly
                        3 cents every time you tip (assuming you tip 10% to the author and give yourself 90%).
                        You are also limited to a handful of tips every 8-12 hours and you are forced to wait 10 minutes
                        between
                        every tip.

                    <p>
                        You watch videos. Every video, there will be an ad. Loot.TV takes a cut and gives you the rest.
                        You
                        can
                        then cashout to <a href="https://freecash.com/r/eofr" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Freecash</a> for $1 per 1000 Loot.TV
                        points.
                        That means Freecash takes no cut of your Loot.TV earnings!

                        If you want to leave it running in the background while you do something else, you'll need to

                        Your computer gets turned into a proxy for buisnesses to use to check where their ads are being
                        shown and to check their network stability.
                        Honeygain is the most stable bandwidth sharing site. If you live in a 3rd world country, your
                        earnings will go WAYYYY down.

                        Honeygain pays out in PayPal and JumpTask crypto.

                        Also like Honeygain. If you live in a 3rd world country, your earnings will go WAYYYY down.
                        They pay 20 cents per gigabyte you share.
                        You can expect $5 every month-ish. Maybe slightly less.

                        They can payout in PayPal, Bitcoin ($1.50 fee), Visa giftcards, Google Play giftcards, Amazon
                        giftcards, and more. They have a LOT of giftcards.

                        link, watching YouTube videos, or finding locations on Google Maps. its very easy, and you can
                        get 5 cents per click. No joke.
